/**
 * Resolves a user-typed player name to an online {@link Player}, tolerating the
 * username prefix Floodgate puts on Bedrock accounts.
 *
 * <p>Floodgate joins a Bedrock account under a prefixed Java-side username --
 * {@code .acarm} for a player who thinks of themselves as {@code carm} -- using the
 * {@code username-prefix: "."} default from Floodgate's shipped {@code config.yml}.
 * Neither Bukkit lookup handles this: {@link Bukkit#getPlayerExact(String)} is an exact
 * match, and {@link Bukkit#getPlayer(String)} matches a prefix of the *name*, so
 * {@code getPlayer("carm")} does not find {@code .acarm} either -- that name starts with
 * a dot, not a {@code c}. An operator naming the unprefixed form gets "not online" for a
 * player standing in front of them.
 *
 * <p>This matters more than an ordinary lookup nicety because Bedrock players get no tab
 * completion at all: Geyser bakes the whole command tree into one login packet and never
 * sends command-suggestion packets, so a Bedrock player cannot discover the prefixed
 * form. That is also why {@link #noSuchPlayerMessage} names who *is* online instead of
 * dead-ending -- it is the only channel through which the correct name reaches them.
 *
 * <p>The prefix is hardcoded to Floodgate's default rather than made configurable. A
 * plugin config key would be a second, unvalidatable source of truth for a value owned by
 * a different plugin's config, and it would silently rot if the server changed one and not
 * the other. A server that has reconfigured the prefix still resolves through the
 * case-insensitive sweep in {@link #resolve}.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately duplicated per plugin rather than extracted to a shared library; see
 * the ecosystem design note on why no shared module exists across these repositories.
